Documentary filmmaking often means working fast in unpredictable conditions. You can't ask real life to wait while you adjust your lights. Over the years, I've refined a gear setup that prioritizes mobility without sacrificing quality.

## The Philosophy

My approach: the best shot is the one you capture. I'd rather have slightly imperfect footage of an authentic moment than miss it entirely because I was fiddling with equipment.

This doesn't mean gear doesn't matter. It means choosing gear that gets out of your way.

## Camera Body

I've settled on mirrorless full-frame systems. The low-light performance is essential for documentary work where you can't control lighting. Dual card slots are non-negotiable—I've had cards fail at the worst moments. And I need something that doesn't scream "professional camera crew" when I'm trying to blend into environments.

## Lenses

Two lenses handle 90% of my documentary work:

**24-70mm f/2.8** — The workhorse. Versatile enough for interviews, wide enough for establishing shots, long enough for details. If I could only bring one lens, this is it.

**70-200mm f/2.8** — For when you can't get close. Protests, performances, wildlife—anything where physical proximity isn't possible. The compression also adds cinematic quality to interviews when you have the space.

I've stopped carrying primes for documentary work. The time spent changing lenses is time you're not shooting.

## Audio

Sound is half the film, maybe more. My kit always includes:

- Wireless lavalier system (two transmitters minimum)
- Shotgun mic on camera
- Portable recorder as backup

I've learned the hard way that redundancy in audio saves projects. A beautiful shot with unusable sound is worthless.

## Stabilization

A compact gimbal goes everywhere with me. Not for every shot—handheld has its own energy that's often right for documentary—but for transitions, establishing shots, and any movement that needs smoothness.

## What I've Stopped Carrying

Just as important as what I bring is what I've eliminated. No more heavy tripods (a monopod handles most needs). No lighting kit unless specifically required. No cases of backup bodies.

Every pound you carry is energy you're not spending on the actual filmmaking. Travel light, stay alert, capture the moment.
