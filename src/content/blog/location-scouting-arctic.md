Last month I returned from three weeks in northern Norway and Sweden, scouting locations for what would become *Northern Lights*. The trip was equal parts magical and brutal.

## Chasing the Light

Above the Arctic Circle in summer, the sun barely sets. This creates a cinematographer's dream—and nightmare. The golden hour lasts for hours, but you lose any sense of time. We'd start scouting at "evening" and realize at 2 AM that we hadn't stopped for dinner.

The light quality is unlike anywhere else I've filmed. There's a softness to it, a diffusion from the atmosphere that makes everything look like it's been through the most expensive filter imaginable.

## The Logistics

Getting equipment to remote Arctic locations is its own adventure. We shipped gear three weeks ahead to a contact in Tromsø. Even then, reaching our primary locations required snowmobiles, a chartered boat, and one particularly memorable helicopter ride during a storm that I'd rather not repeat.

## Standout Locations

Three spots made it into the final film:

**The abandoned mining settlement** — Rows of weathered buildings slowly being reclaimed by snow and ice. There's something profound about human structures surrendering to nature. We spent two days here.

**The frozen fjord** — A vast expanse of ice with mountains rising directly from the edges. The scale is impossible to convey in photos. You have to see it in motion to understand.

**The research station** — A functioning outpost where scientists study climate change. This became the emotional anchor of our story—people dedicated to understanding a world that's changing faster than we can document.

## What Scouting Teaches You

Every scout reminds me that films aren't made in editing rooms. They're made in the places you choose to point your camera. The three weeks I spent freezing in the Arctic shaped every frame of the final documentary. That investment of time and discomfort pays dividends you can't fake in post.
