An interview can make or break a documentary. You can have stunning visuals and a compelling narrative structure, but if your subjects don't connect with the audience, the film falls flat. Here's what I've learned about getting authentic, powerful interviews.

## Forget the Questions

I stopped using question lists years ago. Instead, I walk into interviews with three or four themes I want to explore. This keeps the conversation natural and allows me to follow unexpected threads.

The best moments in interviews are the ones you didn't plan for. If you're buried in your notes, you'll miss them.

## The Setup Matters

Where you place someone affects how they speak. I avoid desk setups—they create a barrier. I prefer subjects in spaces that mean something to them. Their workshop. Their kitchen. Somewhere they feel ownership.

Lighting matters too, but not in the way you might think. Soft, flattering light helps people relax. Harsh lighting makes them self-conscious. A comfortable subject is an open subject.

## Silence Is Your Friend

Most interviewers rush to fill silence. Don't. When someone finishes a thought, wait. Count to five in your head. Often, that pause is when they'll add something they've never told anyone—the detail they were holding back, unsure if it mattered.

## The Pre-Interview

I always spend at least an hour with subjects before we roll camera. We talk about everything except the documentary. Their kids. Last night's game. The weather. By the time we start filming, I'm not a stranger with a camera. I'm someone they've been talking to all morning.

## Listen, Don't Perform

Your job isn't to be interesting. It's to make them feel heard. Eye contact. Nodding. Small verbal affirmations. These signals tell your subject that what they're saying matters—because it does.

The best interview I ever conducted, I spoke maybe fifty words total. The subject talked for three hours straight and revealed things that became the emotional core of the film.
