When I first received the call about documenting Antytila, Ukraine's biggest rock band turned combat medics, I knew this project would be unlike anything I'd done before. What I didn't know was how profoundly it would change my approach to filmmaking.

## The Decision to Go

There's always a moment of hesitation before committing to a dangerous shoot. You weigh the story against the risks. In this case, the story won decisively. Here was a band that had sold out arenas, now saving lives on the front lines. That transformation demanded to be documented.

## Adapting to Chaos

Traditional documentary filmmaking relies on planning—shot lists, schedules, controlled environments. War obliterates all of that. We learned to work in 15-minute windows, to capture moments between air raid sirens, to find visual poetry in the most harrowing circumstances.

The key was staying small and mobile. Our core crew was just three people. We could move fast, set up in minutes, and disappear when necessary.

## Finding the Story

The most powerful moments weren't the dramatic ones. They were the quiet conversations in bunkers, the exhaustion in their eyes after a 36-hour shift, the way they still hummed melodies while treating wounds. Music hadn't left them—it had become their survival mechanism.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced something I've always believed: the best documentaries aren't about extraordinary events. They're about ordinary people responding to extraordinary circumstances. Antytila's members aren't superheroes. They're musicians who chose to act when their country needed them.

That's the story worth telling.
