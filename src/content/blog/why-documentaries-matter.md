I've been making documentaries for fifteen years. In that time, I've watched the media landscape transform completely. Attention spans have shortened. Trust in institutions has eroded. Everyone with a smartphone is now a content creator.

And yet, I believe documentary film has never been more important.

## The Long Form Advantage

In a world of 60-second videos and infinite scroll, a 90-minute documentary asks something radical of its audience: sustained attention. That request is itself a statement. It says this story is worth your time. It cannot be summarized in a headline. It requires you to sit with complexity.

This is counter-cultural in the best way. We need spaces for nuance, and documentary provides them.

## Bearing Witness

Documentaries serve as a form of collective memory. When I filmed *Antytila*, I wasn't just making entertainment. I was creating a historical record of a specific moment—how ordinary people responded to extraordinary circumstances. Fifty years from now, that footage will matter in ways none of us can predict.

Every documentary is an act of preservation. We're saying: this happened, these people existed, their stories deserve to be remembered.

## The Trust Factor

Audiences are increasingly skeptical of media, and they should be. But documentary, at its best, operates on a different contract than news or social media. We spend months or years with our subjects. We show our work. We let complexity exist without rushing to conclusions.

That depth builds a different kind of trust—earned through time and transparency rather than claimed through authority.

## The Path Forward

I worry about documentary's future. Funding is harder. Distribution is fragmented. The theatrical experience is diminishing.

But then I see the response to films that matter. I see audiences hungry for substance. I see streaming platforms investing in non-fiction. I see young filmmakers more committed than ever to using the medium for impact.

Documentary will survive because stories need to be told, and some stories need the space that only this form provides.
