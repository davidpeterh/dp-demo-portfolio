            With over fifteen years of experience in film production, I have
            directed award-winning features, documentaries, and commercial
            projects across Europe and North America. My work has been
            recognized at Cannes, Sundance, and the Berlin International
            Film Festival.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in Stockholm and now based in Copenhagen, I draw inspiration
            from the Scandinavian tradition of intimate storytelling—finding
            the extraordinary within ordinary moments. Each project begins
            with a simple question: what does it mean to be human?
          </p>
          <p>
            When not on set, I teach masterclasses at the Danish Film School
            and mentor emerging filmmakers through the Nordic Film Institute.
